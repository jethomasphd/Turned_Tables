    "brief_markdown": "# Vitamin D and Respiratory Infections: What the Papers Say\n\nYou asked whether vitamin D supplements can help your kid get fewer colds. Here is what the research actually shows.\n\n## The short version\n\nIt depends on whether your kid is vitamin D deficient.\n\n## What the papers say\n\nA large meta-analysis of over 10,000 people (PMID: 28202713) found that vitamin D supplementation does reduce respiratory infection risk overall. But the benefit was strongest for people who were deficient to begin with. For people with very low levels (below 25 nmol/L), the risk dropped by about 70%.\n\nHowever, two other trials found no benefit in healthy adults who were not deficient (PMID: 34607774, 30675873). Monthly high doses did not help. Low daily doses in healthy young men did not help either.\n\n## What we infer (with receipts)\n\n1. If your kid's vitamin D is low, supplementation is likely to help. [PMID: 28202713]\n2. Daily or weekly dosing is better than monthly mega-doses. [PMID: 28202713, 34607774]\n3. If vitamin D levels are already normal, don't expect supplements to be a magic shield. [PMID: 34607774, 30675873]\n\n## What to do\n\nAsk your doctor to check your kid's vitamin D level first. That blood test is the receipt that matters. If the level is low, daily supplementation has good evidence behind it. If the level is normal, save your money.\n\n## Confidence: Medium\n\nThe meta-analysis is strong, but the subgroup finding (deficient people benefit most) needs more direct trials in children specifically.",
    "cross_examination": {
      "change_your_mind": "A large RCT in vitamin-D-sufficient children showing clear reduction in respiratory infections would change the conclusion that supplementation mainly helps the deficient.",
      "rival_explanation": "The benefit seen in deficient populations could reflect correction of immune dysfunction rather than a direct antiviral effect of vitamin D. The mechanism matters for whether supplementation is the right intervention vs. dietary/lifestyle changes.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "confidence_justification": "Strong meta-analysis supports the main claim, but contradicting trials in non-deficient populations limit generalizability. The papers studied adults, not children specifically."
